The gridClass is a method of displaying data from an Access Database in a grid format.
The grid is made up of arrays of text boxes and the display form inlcudes a flatscroll bar
and progress bar.

Once the display form has been designed, the load or activate event is used to intialise
the gridClass.

The gridClass must be intialised in the following order:

	No of Columns
	No of Rows
	Population of ColumnDataFields Array
	Population of ColumnDisplay Array
	Set Progress Bar
	Set Scroll Bar
	Database Name
	Recordset
